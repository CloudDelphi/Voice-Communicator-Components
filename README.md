Voice Communicator Components, public full sources release.

Sources are released in hope they will be usefull for someone.

You may find bad design, strange names, questionable choices there. But there are also some good parts I'm proud of.

Feel free to explore and experiment.

Sources should be compatible with Delphi 7 - Delphi 10 (Seattle).

Currently I just made sure you can compile them, which is always a good start :)


# installation

TBD
